# Open Mensa Flutter

This Flutter project utilizes the [OpenMensa API](https://openmensa.org/) to fetch real-time information about the dishes currently being served in German canteens, presented in a visually appealing interface. You can easily save canteens to your personal list for quick acess and mark your favorite dishes.
